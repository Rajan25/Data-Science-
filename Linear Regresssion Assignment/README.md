# Linear Assignment Assignment
> To identify impact factors that drive the Demand of the Rental Bikes for a US based company named BoomBikes


## Table of Contents
* Data Understanding,  Build and evaluate the model, Residual analysis of the train data , Predicting for the test data set
* Python
* Build a multiple linear regression model for predicting the demand

## General Information
- The project is created on a python notebook which builds a multiple linear regression model for predicting the demand for rental bikes.


## Model
- Final Equation:- cnt = 0.2537*Yr(Latest year) + 0.0630 *September + 0.0553*Sunday + 0.0482*workingday - 0.0402*summer - 0.0780*MistCloudy - 0.0872*winter - 0.2035*windspeed - 0.2947*spring + 0.5338 (intercept) 

## Packages Used
- Python 
- matplotlib 
- Sklearn

## Acknowledgements
- This project was developed as part of the master's program at IIIT B and LJMU.
