# Project Name
> This project seeks to use CNN to create a neural network architecture to identify various types of melanoma  from their various sample images.

## General Information
Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. 
It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. 


## Conclusions
We created a model which was able to detect the correct type of melanoma 50 % of the time. We used data augmentation to balance out class imbalances and use the new images to train
the model. 


## Technologies Used
